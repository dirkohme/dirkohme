# Welcome
This is GitHub workspace where I will upload my hobby projects. My focus currently is on Arduino based hardware,
especially the <a href="https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html">WeMOS D1 mini</a>. But I'm also interested
in Linux, ARM 64 bit platforms, C/C++, Python, etc.

## Contact
You may contact me here or via <a href="mailto:dirk_ohme@hotmail.com?subject=GitHub+projects">e-mail</a>.
